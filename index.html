            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am an experienced senior data scientist with a demonstrated history of working in financial services and IT consulting. I have a strong background in machine learning and deep learning. Iâ€™ve developed a keen ability to solve complex business problems using data-driven approaches. My aspirations are fueled by the desire to be a part of something bigger than me, contributing towards sustaining a smart world and solving problems that people did not know they had. I am a very career-driven individual who values the social aspect of building and maintaining good relationships with people.</p>

            <h2>Portfolio</h2>
            <p>PROJECTS WORKED ON DURING MY CAREER:
- Anomaly detection machine learning model to monitor operating conditions (with focus on 
 temperature, pressure, density and viscosity of oil) of heavy machinery vehicles in the mining 
 sector. This was crucial to determine the time for the vehicle maintenance cycle.
- Deep learning classification model (U-net neural network architecture) for a game reserve. The 
 model uses live satellite imagery to classify and locate specific animals in the game reserve.
- Raster classification model that was used to classify cultivated and non-cultivated land in 
 agricultural farms.
- Predictive machine learning model for predicting Covid-19 second wave in South Africa; When it 
 was most likely to begin, how long it was going to last and when it was going to end.
- Many more..
